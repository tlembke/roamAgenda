- # Roam Agenda
    - MacOSX only
    - Pastes daily agenda into roam, including
        - Ideas and Projects
        - Today’s Events from iCloud Calendar
        - Today’s Tasks from Things 3
- ## Installation
    - Install roamAgenda.scpt into ~/Library/Scripts
        - You will need to customise the template by editing the first few lines of the code
        - I have embedded blocks called 
            - ‘The Lab’ for ideas in different categories
            - ‘The Market’ for things I need to get from different ‘stalls'
            - ‘Todays Projects’ - things I choose to work on today
            - ‘This Weeks Projects’ - thing to do this week
    - Install roamAgenda.alfredworkflow into Alfred
        - This is a very simple workflow so you can create it yourself
        - Snippet -> Run Script (bin/bash)
            - osascript ~/Library/Scripts/roamAgenda.scpt
    - Install CalendarLib EC
        - download from https://latenightsw.com/support/freeware/
        - place in ~/Library/Script Libraries (which may have to be created)
- ## Useage
        - Type the Alfred hotkey in your Daily Notes
        - I use ‘roama ‘ (ie roama followed by a space) as the hotkey
        - If you like, drag (or reference)Tasks imported from Things to the appropriate Project in Roam
